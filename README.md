# ASC23 Transport Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of transport data with a focus on vehicles and fuel efficiency. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The goal is to visualize the relationships between different features of the dataset and interpret these visualizations to provide insights that could be valuable for AI modeling purposes.

## Introduction

This project is part of the ASC23 assignment that focuses on the analysis of transport-related data to provide region-focused contributions for global stocktake. This specific analysis revolves around vehicle types and their fuel efficiency. The goal is to uncover insights using visual data analysis techniques that can later be used in AI models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information on various vehicle types, their attributes, and fuel efficiency. The dataset was provided as part of the assignment and is included in the repository.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are necessary to run the notebook:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For making statistical graphics and enhancing `matplotlib` visualizations.

## Visualizations

Two primary types of visualizations were created:

1. **Histogram**: A histogram was plotted to show the distribution of the 'Fuel Efficiency' feature in the dataset. This helps to understand the spread and skewness of the data.

2. **Heatmap**: A heatmap was generated to show the correlation between different features of the dataset. This helps to identify any relationships between variables, which can be critical for feature selection in AI modeling.

## Interpretation

### Histogram Interpretation

The histogram of fuel efficiency shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most vehicles have moderate to low fuel efficiency. This suggests a need to focus on improving fuel efficiency in vehicle design or promoting more efficient models.

### Heatmap Interpretation

The heatmap reveals significant correlations between several features, such as engine size and fuel consumption. Strong correlations suggest that certain features could be redundant in AI models, and dimensionality reduction techniques might be useful.
